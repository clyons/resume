  summary: <p>The Singapore Quantified Self Meetup is inspired by the Bay Area Quantified Self meetup and the Quantified Self blog [quantifiedself.com].</p><p>It's a show and tell for people who are tracking data about their body and conducting their own personal investigations and research into their bodies, minds, and selves.</p><p>I found it weird that it didn't exist in Singapore, so I set it up. I was expecting five like-minded nerds to join, but now we are hundreds. Do you wear a Fitbit or ever step on a scales? You should probably join.</p>
